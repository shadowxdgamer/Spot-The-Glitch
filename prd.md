Product Requirements Document: Spot the Glitch1. Project OverviewSpot the Glitch is a high-speed, roguelike perception puzzle game. The player acts as a digital auditor scanning data arrays for "corrupted" artifacts. The game blends the simplicity of "Odd One Out" puzzles with the strategic depth of a roguelike deck-builder.2. Core Gameplay LoopScan Phase: Player identifies 1 or more anomalies in a grid of varying complexity (numbers, letters, or Galactic Runes).Progression: Every 5 levels, the "Integrity" of the system is tested, opening the Upgrade Protocol (Shop).Choice Phase: Player selects 1 of 3-5 randomized modification cards. Every benefit (e.g., clearing the board) comes with a technical curse (e.g., increasing grid size).Survival: The game ends when "System Integrity" (Lives) reaches zero or the timer expires.3. Key MechanicsA. The Roguelike ShopWeighted Rarity: Drop rates for Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary cards shift as the player reaches higher Sectors.Modification Cards:Benefits: Data Cleansing (deleting tiles), Time Buffers, Stability Repairs, Expansion Packs (more card choices).Curses: Array Expansion, Anomaly Sprouts, Signal Scrambling (harder characters).Reroll System: Players get 1 free reroll per shop, then must spend accumulated reroll charges.B. Procedural DifficultyInstead of linear scaling, the difficulty is player-driven. The board only gets harder if the player chooses powerful benefits that carry heavy curses.4. Visual & Audio IdentityAesthetic: "Cyber-Audit Terminal." High-contrast neon on obsidian.Visual Effects: Chromatic aberration, scanlines, and CSS glitch animations.Audio Strategy:BGM: A low-frequency, monophonic pulse that increases in tempo as the timer low.SFX (Procedural): * Success: High-frequency "ping."Failure: Low-frequency distorted "buzz."UI: Soft mechanical clicks for navigation and card selection.5. Technical StackFrontend Framework: React (JavaScript) powered by Vite.Architecture: Feature-first architecture. Code is organized into modular directories based on game features (e.g., src/features/grid, src/features/shop, src/features/audio) to ensure scalability and separation of concerns.Styling: Tailwind CSS for layout and utilities, paired with CSS Modules or global CSS for specialized "glitch" animations and custom neon variables.State Management: React Context API or specialized hooks for game state, persistence, and modifier tracking.Audio: Web Audio API (Oscillators/Gain nodes) for zero-latency, asset-free sound generation.6. Future RoadmapGlobal Leaderboards: Using Cloud Storage to track high scores.Special Abilities: Active "Breach" moves that slow time.Daily Challenges: Fixed seeds for competitive play.
